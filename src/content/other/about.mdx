**Hey there, I'm Aimee!** 

*A tech geek, music enthusiast and cat lover.*

This blog is where I dive into my obsessions, share knowledge and (hopefully) build connections.  

I like exploring new things while listening to my favorite tunes. I want to share the challenges I've solved along the way.  Also, you'll find plenty of my passions and hobbies sprinkled in here too. 

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
