Hello, on this post I will share some twitter posts about Sohyun and Jiyeon.

>They're probably my main biases in tripleS. I had never looked at their interactions in depth before (I know I feel like fake fan lol) and I found something interesting: I swear every member of tripleS has had a crush on Sohyun at some point haha.
They're kind of opposites, meaning Jiyeon is more femenine and elegant (though recently said something like "Wouldn't it have been fine even if I'd been born a man?") while Sohyun says she really doesn't care but her masc/futch? side comes out a lot, naturally... yet her pretty and cute side is so adorable. I find them really captivating..
It's not like I ship them but it's an intresting dynamic, like the "opposites attract" thing and the way they play with gender identities.
I mean, my brain changed since I read this fanfic: [metrome](https://archiveofourown.org/works/76561691), I felt inspired so here I am.

Ok, so here are some posts I found:
