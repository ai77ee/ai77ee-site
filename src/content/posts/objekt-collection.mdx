So I'm super new to this, but I wanted to collect some Jiyeon objekts (and maybe some others from my bias).
I'm going to take it slow but I have a few already, so I thought I would share my pretty small collection here.
Well, I defenitely won't be able to get all of the Jiyeon objekts, but I will try to get as many as I can.

This is just for fun haha I will try not to spend too much money on this, because I have a dream that one day tripleS will be able to perform in my country so it's better to save some money for that VIP access or meet and greet if possible, right? haha.
But I think the best thing about this is that I can interact with other wavs and even making friends through this process, so I think it's worth it.
